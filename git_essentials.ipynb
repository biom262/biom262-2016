    "\n",
    "There's been some confusion about what's the difference between `git` and GitHub, and specifically when you make changes using `git` but don't see them on GitHub. \n",
    "\n",
    "### `git` is the program you use for tracking changes\n",
    "This will be a sped-up version of the `git` intro from Software Carpentry and will hit all the high points that you need to remember for working with `git` in this class.\n",

    "Let's start with a fresh new repository.\n",

    "Initial commit\n",
    "\n",
    "nothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)\n",

    "\n",
    "There's no files here yet. Just like in the git tutorial, we'll create a few empty files and then see how this changes the `git` repo.\n",

    "$ touch plots.sh\n",

    "At this point, **`git` has no idea that these files matter to you**. Where it says \"`Untracked files`\", it shows a list of files that `git` sees, but doesn't think you care about so it's not *tracking* their changes. Let's `git add` and `git commit` these files. I'm going to be lazy and add everything that ends in \"`.sh`\".\n",

    "### GitHub is the place you put files so you don't lose your dissertation work when you computer explodes\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've `git add`'d, `git commit`'d and everything, GitHub (the place) still has no idea what you've done. It's only when you `git push` and `git pull` that you talk to GitHub and tell them you've made some updates.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you \"Fork\" a repository (repo), you make a copy that you personally can edit, commit, add, and push changes to. When you \"Clone\" a repository, you're copying all history of all code that was ever written in that project. If it's your project, then you have write access. Otherwise, no. Usually you don't have write access to things you're cloning.\n",

    "\n",
    "One thing we didn't go over in class is that if your code is up somewhere publicly available without an explicit license, then technically nobody is allowed to use it. That's why using a license for your code (I recommend the [UCSD-specific 3-Clause BSD license \"UCSD Software Copyright Notice\"](https://confluence.crbs.ucsd.edu/display/CRBS/Releasing+Open+Source+Software+at+UCSD) we used for the first homework because it allows for the most people to use it - academics, companies, industry, non-profit, for-profit - without restrictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "There's another license called the GPL that many people use and is (in my opinion) a little idealistic because it prevents the usage of the code in a properitary setting (i.e. Microsoft can't use it privately within the compnay). If you're interested in open source license, I encourage you to browse [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/).\n",
