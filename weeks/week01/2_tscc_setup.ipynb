It can ask you for a password, which will have to match exactly, or it will check whether you are an \"Authorized User\" by looking at your `~/.ssh/` file and whether your private key `~/.ssh/id_rsa` matches its list of authorized keys in the servers `authorized_keys` file. What underlies this concept, which is called \"Public Key Cryptography,\" is cryptography, number theory, and hashing - learn more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography).\n",
