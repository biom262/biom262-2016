    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks are a way that you can have code, text, images, and math all live together in harmony. This concept can be called \"[Literate Proramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)\", where all code that is written also has comments or an explanation of *why* it was written (which is not always obvious). In particular, the Jupyter notebook allows you to write some code, run (evaluate) it, and see the output all in once. This is called a \"read-eval-print loop\" or [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).\n",
