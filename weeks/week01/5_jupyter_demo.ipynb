    "[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks are a way that you can have code, text, images, and math all live together in harmony. This concept can be called \"[Literate Proramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming)\", where all code that is written also has comments or an explanation of *why* it was written (which is not always obvious). In particular, the Jupyter notebook allows you to write some code, run (evaluate) it, and see the output all in once. This is called a \"read-eval-print loop\" or [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop).\n",

    "### Quick Guide to Markdown Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Headers:\n",
    "- Prepend text with \"#\" or \"##\" depending on size of desired header text (up to header size 6 = \"######\").  \n",
    "- See the 2 headers above for examples of 1 and 2 level header sizes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Formatting:\n",
    "- Markdown does not automatically hard-wrp carriage returns.\n",
    "    - Insert your own break by ending the line with two spaces and then typing Return.\n",
    "- *Italics* = 1 \"*\" or \"_\"\n",
    "- **Bold** = 2 \"**\" or \"__\"\n",
    "- `monospace` text (for code) is initiated by a prepending '\\`' character\n",
    "- Use \"\\\" or a preceeding tab to remove formatting issues caused by markdown language syntax.\n",
