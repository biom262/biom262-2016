    "## What is an annotation?\n",
    "An annotation is a flag denoting a special characteristic to a particular base pair or string of base pairs in a DNA sequence.  The most common type of annotation assigns particular chromosomal coordinates to a gene ID (and its associated metadata.)  Genetic sequence is most commonly stored in strings of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T' (fasta format).  Annotations are sometimes bundled with sequence (gbk, genbank file) or downloaded separately in memory efficient formats like GTF and BED.\n",

    "1. Chromosome name\n",
    "2. Start of the feature (0-based, so the first base of the genome is \"0\")\n",
    "3. Stop of the feature (0-based, so not inclusive). This is for computer science reasons, most programming langauges are written such that the \"0th\" item is the first thing. So then the \"100th\" item would then actually be the 101th element. To avoid the \"off by one error\" (a common problem in bioinformatics) then we use 0-based indexing, where `feature1` above starts at base 0 and ends at base 100, and thus is of length 100.\n",
    "4. Name of the feature\n",
    "5. Score of the feature, which is some integer from 0 to 1000. Some bed files come with a dot/period \"`.`\" here instead if it doesn't make sense for them to have a score, but there's programs that will complain that your `bed` file is improperly formatted so I end up using `awk` or something to fill that column with 1000 for every row.\n",
    "6. Strand of the feature. If a strand doesn't make sense (e.g. for DNA methylation) then a dot/period \"`.`\"  is here.\n",
