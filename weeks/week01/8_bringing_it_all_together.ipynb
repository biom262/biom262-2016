    "\n",
    "### `stdout`: The other white meat\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use `>`, the technical jargon for what you are doing is \"redirecting standard output to a file.\" Specifically, `stdout` is considered the \"first\" output of a program and is given the number \"`1`\". So you secretly specified the \"`1`\" already! Try the `ls` command again, but use `1>` to save the `stdout`. You should get the same output as if you did it without the `1` (do it to convince yourself)\n",

    "\n",
    "You may be wondering what is the point of this step is:\n",

    "Hello I am a message in standard error (stderr)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But what about this?\n",
