The <font style=\"background-color: #A292FE\">purple</font> distribution is the null distribution, and the <font style=\"background-color: #F49816\">orange</font> distribution is the hypothesized alternative distribution (in reality we don't know what the actual parameter value is). The solid colors represent the regions where the inference matches reality.  The dotted regions represent the regions of error. The dashed <font style=\"background-color: #00CC33\">green</font> line marks the p&#770; cutoff value that gives the specified <font style=\"background-color: #DDD7FC\">significance level (or false alarm/type I error rate)</font>.<br/><br/>\n",
