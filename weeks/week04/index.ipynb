    "- Using the authors' data submitted to GEO\n",
    "- Mapping to the `mm10` mouse genome using STAR and quantifying gene expression using `featureCounts`\n",
    "- Using `kallisto` to do quasi-mapping and gene quantification\n",
    "- Using simple correlation and statistics to analyze the data and find differentially expressed genes\n",
